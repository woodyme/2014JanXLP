Project XLP 2014 Jan
==========

This project is dedicated to information related to XLP activity development for January 2014.

This is the first time that we started using version control services to track all project activities.

The content of this project should include:

1. Human Organization Design Documents
2. Activity Design Documents. (some multi-media files, but for large video or image files, put it in a separate directory.)
3. A small set of template documents in various formats. Say Words, Mathematica, Matlab scripts, and some Java, JavaScript code.
